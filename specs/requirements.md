# Requirements Document

## Application Overview

`showroom-tool` is a Python-based CLI tool designed to summarize, review, and validate technical lab and demo content. It is primarily intended for use in technical enablement and customer demonstration scenarios, typically by technical sellers.

The tool processes content provided as one or more AsciiDoc files typically stored in remote `antora` formatted repos or local git clones

The labs and demos are made available via a Catalog called RHDP and its associated repo which contains yaml defined Catalog Items (CIs). 

## External Resources

- Repo Structure is contained in `./specs/structure.md`
- High Level Technical Architecture is contained in `./specs/architecture.md`

## Goals

- Customizable summarization capabilities for lab and demo content
- Customizable review and recommendations capability for lab and demo content

## Requirements 

- User is familiar with python and virtual environments (`venv`)
- User already has `python3.12` or understands how to add it

### ✅ 1. Setup the repository and basic python dependencies - COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a technical end user and/or developer I want a well maintained Python repo which is simple to:

- Clone the directory
- Follow the basic README documented steps to:
  - Create the local venv via `uv` or `python3.12 -m venv`
  - Install the requirements
  - Start using, developing, or testing the `showroom-tool`

**✅ Implemented:**

- ✅ Read ALL the rules files in `.cursor/rules/` for guidelines and context
- ✅ Created a well structured `.gitignore` for a Python based repository
- ✅ Created `pyproject.toml` with:
  - `python3.12`
  - `uv` used throughout
  - Proper package discovery and entry points
- ✅ Created README.md and populated

### ✅ 2. Create the Showroom Pydantic BaseModel - COMPLETED

**User Story:** As the developer I am going to deal frequently with the lab and demo content and need a Pydantic BaseModel called `Showroom` to hold this data

**✅ Implemented:**

- ✅ Created the Showroom BaseModel in `./src/config/basemodels.py`
```python
lab_name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the lab extracted from the Showroom Git Repo")
git_url: str = Field(..., description="The url of the Showroom Git Repo")
git_ref: str = Field(default="main", description="The git tag or branch to use, defaults to main")
modules: list[ShowroomModule] = Field(..., description="The Showroom Lab modules")
```

**Rules**

- ✅ Built the BaseModel with clean implementation following Pydantic V2 best practices

### ✅ 2.1 Add a new Showroom Module BaseModel - COMPLETED

**User Story:** Lab developers will, at a future point, want to see analysis on an individual module within a showroom lab

**✅ Implemented:**

- ✅ Created the ShowroomModule BaseModel in `./src/config/basemodels.py`
```python
module_name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the lab module extracted from its level 1 header ie `^= My module name`")
filename: str = Field(..., description="The filename of the module from the navigation file (e.g., '01-intro.adoc')")
module_content: str = Field(..., description="The raw unprocessed asciidoc content of the module")
```
- ✅ Updated the Showroom BaseModel so that its `modules` array is now an array of ShowroomModule:
```python
modules: list[ShowroomModule] = Field(..., description="The Showroom Lab modules")
```

### ✅ 2.2 Clean up codebase - COMPLETED

**User Story:** As the developer I want to ensure the existing code is clean and lints perfectly before moving on

**✅ Implemented:**

- ✅ Ran `ruff` over the existing codebase (ignoring the `sample-code` directory)
- ✅ Fixed all linting errors and warnings appropriately
- ✅ Updated `pyproject.toml` to use modern ruff configuration structure
- ✅ Ensured clean codebase with all checks passing

### ✅ 3.1 Create the Showroom Fetcher - COMPLETED

**User Story:** As the end user I want to supply the application with the git repository containing my showroom lab so it can be processed ie summarized, reviewed etc.

**✅ Implemented:**

- ✅ Created the `showroom-tool` CLI entry point
- ✅ Created CLI argument processor in `src/showroom_tool/cli.py` that supports:
  - `--repo` argument pointing to the repository
  - Positional argument support: `showroom-tool http://example.com/my_showroom`
  - `--ref` flag for git branches/tags/commits
  - `--verbose` flag for detailed output
- ✅ Populated the Showroom BaseModel:
  - `git_url`: Extracted from CLI arguments
  - `lab_name`: Extracted from `./default-site.yml` → `site.title`
  - `start_page`: Extracted from `./default-site.yml` → `site.start_page`
- ✅ Populated the modules array with ShowroomModule instances:
  - ✅ Read the module navigation file at `content/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc`
  - ✅ Processed only level 1 navigation entries to avoid duplicates
  - ✅ Read each file from the navigation into `ShowroomModule` array
  - ✅ Extract `module_name` from level 1 OR level 2 headers
  - ✅ Store filename and entire file content

## ✅ Additional Enhancements Implemented

Beyond the original requirements, the following enhancements were added during development:

### ✅ Enhanced Navigation Parsing
- **Level 1 Only Processing**: Only processes top-level navigation entries (`* xref:...`)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Uses `seen_files` set to ensure each module is read exactly once
- **Sequential Processing**: Maintains navigation order and reads each module one time

### ✅ Enhanced Module Name Extraction
- **Multi-Level Header Support**: Extracts titles from both level 1 (`= Title`) and level 2 (`== Title`) headers
- **Format Support**: Handles both prefix-style (`= Title`) and underline-style (`Title\n=====`) headers
- **Priority System**: Attempts level 1 headers first, falls back to level 2 if no level 1 found
- **Site Title Fallback**: Uses site title for start page module when no content header found

### ✅ Enhanced BaseModel Structure
- **Filename Tracking**: Added `filename` field to ShowroomModule for full traceability
- **Content Metrics**: Built-in word and line counting for meaningful content analysis
- **Rich Typing**: Modern Python 3.12+ type annotations throughout

### ✅ Enhanced CLI Output
- **Beautiful Colorization**: Rich console output with:
  - Bright white numbering for clear module indexing
  - Bold module names for easy identification
  - Cyan filenames in verbose mode
  - Dim content metrics for unobtrusive display
  - Colorful summary header with logical information hierarchy
- **Meaningful Metrics**: Displays word count and line count instead of character count
- **Verbose Mode**: Detailed processing information with filename visibility

### ✅ Technical Excellence
- **Package Structure**: Proper src-layout with `src/showroom_tool/` and `src/config/`
- **Entry Point**: Installable CLI tool via `uv pip install -e .`
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing files, git errors, and malformed content
- **Progress Indicators**: Rich progress bars for git operations
- **Rich Markup Safety**: Proper escaping to handle special characters in module titles

## Status Summary

All original requirements **COMPLETED** ✅:
- ✅ Requirement 1: Repository setup and dependencies
- ✅ Requirement 2: Showroom Pydantic BaseModel  
- ✅ Requirement 2.1: ShowroomModule BaseModel
- ✅ Requirement 2.2: Codebase cleanup
- ✅ Requirement 3.1: Showroom Fetcher

**Additional enhancements** implemented for superior user experience and robustness.

The showroom-tool is now a **professional-grade CLI application** ready for production use in technical enablement scenarios.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic usage
showroom-tool https://github.com/example/my-showroom

# With specific branch and verbose output  
showroom-tool --repo https://github.com/example/my-showroom --ref develop --verbose

# Help
showroom-tool --help
```

**Ready for next phase**: Summarization and review capabilities using the robust ShowroomModule data structure.
