# Python Rules

## General Rules

- Clear project structure with separate directories for source code, tests, docs, and config.
- Use a modular design with separate files for models, services, controllers, and utilities.
- Write well-commented code and functions to ensure clarity.
- Provide detailed documentation using docstrings and README files.
- Manage configuration using environment variables.
- Strive for simplicity and avoid overly complex code or configuration.
- Create comprehensive tests using `pytest`.
- Manage dependencies with `uv` and Python virtual environments.
- Code style consistency using Ruff.
- Lint via Ruff.
- AI-friendly coding practices: descriptive names, type hints, detailed comments, and rich error context.

## Runtime Rules

- **Always** execute code in the local `venv` via `uv`
- Create a `pyproject.toml` and maintain
- All executable Python files should start with a shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python``
