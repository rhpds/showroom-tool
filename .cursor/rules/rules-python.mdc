# Python Rules

## General Rules

- Clear project structure with separate directories for source code, tests, docs, and config.
- Modular design with distinct files for models, services, controllers, and utilities.
- Well commented code and functions throughout **strive for clarity**
- Detailed documentation using docstrings and README files.
- Configuration management using environment variables.
- Avoid overly complex code and configuration **strive for simplicity**
- Crete comprehensive testing with pytest.
- Dependency management via uv and virtual environments.
- Code style consistency using Ruff.
- AI-friendly coding practices: descriptive names, type hints, detailed comments, and rich error context.

## Runtime Rules

- **Always** execute code in the local `venv` via `uv`
- Create a `pyproject.toml` and maintain
- All executable Python files should start with a shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python``
