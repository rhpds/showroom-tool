  "lab_summary": "This lab provides a hands-on introduction to Agentic AI and its application in cloud operations. Participants will learn how to use Python to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) and build AI Agents capable of automating complex tasks. The lab covers key concepts such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and ReAct prompting, tool calling, and agent architecture. Participants will explore how to enable agents with tools to interact with external systems and perform actions. The lab also discusses the transition of AI Agent applications from development to production, highlighting considerations for deploying on platforms like OpenShift. The exercises are performed within a JupyterLab environment, using `ollama` as a runtime for the LLM."
