  "lab_summary": "This lab provides a hands-on introduction to Agentic AI and its application in cloud operations. Participants will learn how to use Python to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) and build AI Agents capable of automating complex tasks. The lab covers key concepts such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and ReAct prompting, tool calling, and agent architecture. It emphasizes the importance of thoughtful agent design and explores the use of frameworks like Llama Stack for production deployment. The exercises are performed within a JupyterLab environment, utilizing a RHEL 9.5 virtual machine with an NVIDIA GPU. The lab also touches upon future standards like Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol for multi-agent collaboration."
